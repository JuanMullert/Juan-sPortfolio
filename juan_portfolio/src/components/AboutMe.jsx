      <p>
        Iâ€™m a 21 years old Junior Full-Stack Developer. Passion, patience and consistency are three essential qualities
                  I've developed as an early web developer. These values have helped me finish my assignments without 
                 being too overwhelmed.
                              
                I joined Vanderbilt Web Development Bootcamp to shape my skills 
                 as much as possible and to expand my vision as well as my perception of what is to be a Web Developer. 
                  This field has shown in the past and present to be an important part in every large or small company, making the look of 
                   the website a way to attract more customers, 
                   in my opinion it will continue to be this way in the near and long future.
